## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-I learned how to use the <del> and <span> tags to create an element for screen readers only.
- I learned that setting height to 100%, as suggested in some CSS reset blogs, pushes the content up somehow when a screenshot is taken on frontendmentor.io.


### Continued development

I need to try to do it again soon, maybe using grid to practice.

### Useful resources

I received valuable comments from frontendmentor users. 
I also checked other people's code, and learned quite a bit.
